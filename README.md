# rbxobfusc
Obfuscates RBXML script contents into an extremely confusing format.

Thanks to mlnlover11 for XFuscator!

### Syntax
> `lua5.2 rbxobfusc.lua <input_file> [output_file]`

### Warnings
1.  Only runs on Lua 5.2 to my knowledge.
2.  A lot of fancy lua footwork will blow up when you use this.  Best used on a place full of independent scripts so that everything isn't obliterated if there's a miss step.
3.  If you are stupid enough to overwrite your old file, there's nothing I or anyone else can do to retrieve your source.  You've been warned!
